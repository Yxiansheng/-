# 二叉树

## 遍历方式

### 中序遍历

```[js]
const inorderTraversal = (root) => {
    let arr = []
    let current = root
    let stack = []

    while (current || stack.length) {
        while (current) {
            stack.push(current)
            current = current.left
        }
        current = stack.pop()
        arr.push(current.data)
        if (current.right) current = current.right
    }
    return result
}
```

### 前序遍历

```[js]
const preorderTraversal = (root) => {
    const stack = []
    const result = []
    let current = root

    while (current || stack.length) {
        while (current) {
            result.push(current.data)
            stack.push(current.left)
            current = current.left
        }
        current = stack.pop()
        current = current.right
    }
    return result
}
```

### 后序遍历

```[js]
var postorderTraversal = function(root) {
    const stack = []
    const result = []
    let current = root
    let last = null
    while (current || stack.length) {
        while (current) {
            stack.push(current)
            current = current.left
        }
        current = stack[stack.length - 1]
        if (!current.right || last === current.right) {
            current = stack.pop()
            result.push(current.val)
            last = current
            current = null
        } else {
            current = current.right
        }
    }
    return result
};
```
